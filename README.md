## File Transfer UI Component

This project facilitates both file **download** and **upload** operations through a user-friendly UI with real-time progress indicators and potential support for aborting transfers. It is designed to provide a seamless experience for transferring files programmatically and interactively.

## Features Overview

---

### üì• Download

The download process is designed to be programmatically initiated, and visually tracked through the UI. It involves downloading a file in discrete **chunks**, converting it to a downloadable object, and triggering the download via a dynamically generated anchor element.

#### Functional Steps:

1. **List Retrieval**  
   The system first retrieves and displays a list of available files for download.

2. **Programmatic Download**  
   Upon user interaction, a selected file can be downloaded programmatically.

3. **Chunked Downloading**  
   The file is fetched in **chunks**, allowing real-time feedback and better handling of large files.

4. **Progress Tracking**  
   During chunked transfer, download progress is continuously tracked and **reflected in the UI**, providing users with a visual progress indicator.

5. **Optional Abort**  
   There is potential for an **abort** mechanism to cancel the download in progress, enhancing user control.

6. **File Assembly**  
   Once all chunks are received, they are merged into a single **Blob** object.

7. **Download Trigger**  
   A URL is created from the Blob, assigned to a hidden **anchor element**, and triggered to initiate the download.

### üì§ Upload

The upload functionality allows users to send files to a server or destination through direct selection or optional drag-and-drop. It supports progress indication, error handling, and list updates upon completion.

#### Functional Steps:

1. **File Input Interface**  
   Users can select files via a standard input field. **Drag-and-drop (d‚Äôn‚Äôd)** functionality may be optionally supported.

2. **Event Handling**  
   When a file is selected (`onChange`), it triggers the upload process. The implementation may support **on-demand uploading** (initiated after a trigger, rather than instantly).

3. **Uploading Process**  
   Files are uploaded using a controlled mechanism, potentially in chunks or streams, with the **upload status** being monitored.

4. **Progress Display**  
   The UI provides **visual feedback** of upload progress, improving user experience and transparency.

5. **Optional Abort**  
   There may be support for aborting an in-progress upload.

6. **Completion Handling**  
   Upon completion, the system reacts with a **success** message or handles a **failure** if the upload fails.

7. **List Update**  
   After a successful upload, the list of available or uploaded files is **refreshed** to reflect the new state.

## Technical Considerations

- Both upload and download processes leverage **asynchronous operations** with progress feedback, enhancing UX.
- Chunk-based transfer is key for robustness, allowing partial progress recovery and better performance over unstable networks.
- Aborting transfers (both upload and download) may involve signal handling or cancellation tokens, depending on the underlying implementation.
- Blob and URL creation for download ensures compatibility with modern browser APIs, minimizing the need for external libraries.
- UI integration assumes dynamic state updates and possibly use of event listeners or reactive UI frameworks.

## Possible Enhancements

- Drag-and-drop support for uploads (if not yet implemented).
- Retry mechanisms on upload failure.
- User notifications or logs for completed actions.
- Accessibility enhancements for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## Structure

- `server/` - local server for uploading and downloading files
- `client/` - client-side interaction with the server
